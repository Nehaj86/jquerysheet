What is jQuery.sheet?
jQuery.sheet gives you all sorts of possibilities when it comes to giving your web application a spreadsheet style interface with MS Excel style calculations.

jQuery.sheet addresses the web-based spreadsheet or "websheet" in a different, simple, approach - using html, you simply load the sheet from a url, and you save it to a url... Simple.  Or write your own approch. jQuery.sheet manages the sheet creation, viewing, and editing processes, you simply build your application around it.


jQuery.sheet is also theme-able, using jQuery UI ThemeRoller, so you make the spreadsheet look like you want.For a complete list of all the MS Excel style functions that jQuery.sheet supports, take a look at the Demo, which is the documentation.

Why did I start jQuery.sheet?  I like a challenge, I like to learn, I like to contribute, and I saw where other attempts at the same thing, although being nice, could be improved.  And with the web basically migrating in it's entirety over to jQuery, I wanted to put some fun back into my javascripting.
